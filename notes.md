# Order Pizza
Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.

# Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

* Code meets standards from previous weeks.
* Objects drive business logic (in JavaScript, not jQuery).
* Constructors and prototypes are used successfully.
* Application works as expected.
* Plain English specs are included in README.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* You are able to discuss the flow of your code and concepts behind it using correct terminology.
